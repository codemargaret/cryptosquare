# _Cryptosquare_

#### _A program to compose secret messages, 08.17.2017_

#### By _**Margaret Berry and Javier Jimenez**_

## Description
_The program takes a sentence, removes spaces and punctuation and downcases capital letters, and writes the characters into a square or rectangle. A sentence with 69 characters would be written into a rectangle with 9 rows and 8 columns. The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right, outputting encoded text in groups of five letters_
